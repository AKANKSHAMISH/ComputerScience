1. Given relations r(w, x) and s(y, z), the result of 
select distinct w, x 
from r, s 
is guaranteed to be same as r, provided (GATE CS 2000) 
(a) r has no duplicates and s is non-empty 
(b) r and s have no duplicates 
(c) s has no duplicates and r is non-empty 
(d) r and s have the same number of tuples 


2. Given the following relation instance. 
 

x  y  z
1  4  2
1  5  3
1  6  3
3  2  2 
Which of the following functional dependencies are satisfied by the instance? (GATE CS 2000) 
(a) XY -> Z and Z -> Y 
(b) YZ -> X and Y -> Z 
(c) YZ -> X and X -> Z 
(d) XZ -> Y and Y -> X

8. Claim: A×B=∅ iff A=∅ or B=∅

Proof: If A=∅ or B=∅, then there is no (a,b) such that a∈A and b∈B. Therefore A×B, which is the set of these pairs, is empty.

If A≠∅ and B≠∅, there exists a∈A and b∈B, thus (a,b)∈A×B. Therefore A×B≠∅.
