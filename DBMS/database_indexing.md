According to [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]]'s definition, a B-tree of order ''m'' is a tree which satisfies the following properties:{{sfn|Knuth|1998|p=483}}

# Every node has at most ''m'' children.
# Every internal node has at least ⌈''m''/2⌉ children.
# Every non-leaf node has at least two children.
# All leaves appear on the same level and carry no information.
# A non-leaf node with ''k'' children contains ''k''&minus;1 keys.
