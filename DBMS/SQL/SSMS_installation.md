Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is a software application first launched with Microsoft SQL Server 2005 that is used for configuring, managing, and administering all components within Microsoft SQL Server.
It is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.

But we have many software like My SQL by Oracle, Db2 by IBM so why we are using SSMS ?

Because Microsoft SQL Server has simple and easy to understandable Interface and it is ideal for storing all the desired information in relational databases, as well as to manage such data without complications.

For companies, using this tool is essential because of the facilities it offers and the utilities it has. If you have a list of customers, a product catalog or even a large selection of multimedia content available, Microsoft SQL Server helps to manage absolutely everything. It is essential for the proper functioning of a website or any application.
