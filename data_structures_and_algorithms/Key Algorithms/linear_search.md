# Linear Search Algorithm:-

Linear search (known as sequential search) is an algorithm for finding a target value within a list. 
It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until 
all the elements have been searched.Linear search is implemented using following steps...

## linear search is implemented using following steps:-
Step 1 - Read the search element from the user.
Step 2 - Compare the search element with the first element in the list.
Step 3 - If both are matched, then display "Given element is found!!!" and terminate the function
Step 4 - If both are not matched, then compare search element with the next element in the list.
Step 5 - Repeat steps 3 and 4 until search element is compared with last element in the list.
Step 6 - If last element in the list also doesn't match, then display "Element is not found!!!" 
and terminate the function.

##Time Complexity of Linear Search:

Linear Search follows the sequential access. The time complexity of Linear Search is O(n).
